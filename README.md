## C Programs Collection

This repository contains a collection of programs written in the C programming language. These programs are designed to help students understand fundamental concepts in C, such as:

- Control structures (if-else, loops)
- Functions
- Input/output operations
- Basic algorithms (e.g., Fibonacci series, Armstrong number, leap year check)

### How to Use

1. Browse the `.c` files to view different program examples.
2. Compile any program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
	```sh
	gcc filename.c -o filename.exe
	```
3. Run the compiled executable to see the output.

### Purpose

These programs are intended for educational purposes, especially for students learning C programming basics.

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the code!
